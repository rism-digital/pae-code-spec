        The Plaine &amp; Easie Code is a music notation encoding system
        designed for the capture of melodic incipits: Short fragments of
        music notation that help to identify a musical work.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The Plaine &amp; Easie Code was first defined in 1964 by Barry S. Brook and Murray Gould
        [[BrookGould1964]][[Brook1965]]. Perhaps the most important design feature of this system
        was that it could represent music notation with "ordinary" typewriter characters, to be
        put on index cards to build a thematic index to accompany bibliographic source descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The specifics of the code system have changed over time, but, until the present specification,
        the changes have not been clearly versioned. Features have been added to the Plaine &amp; Easie
        Code and the expected publication medium has shifted from index cards to computer systems. These
        changes have resulted in incipits that may have conformed to the specifications at the time, but
        which are now at odds with current practices and methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        The present specification seeks to establish a clearly defined "Version 2"
        of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code. This is an attempt to distinguish it from "Version 1" of the Code,
        which is now fixed at its last revision date. Incipits encoded to the specifications
        given in Version 1 are still valid, and will continue to be.
    </p>
    <p>
        Version 2 of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code is written in a specification language that attempts
        to clearly communicate the normative requirements of the Code. This is a recognition that
        a significant audience for the code is the programmers that create data processing systems.
        This audience needs clear definitions of the code so that it can be accurately and uniformly
        processed for search, retrieval, automated comparison, and notation display.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the same time, however, it must be recognized that the core of this code must remain "Plaine"
        and "Easie" to facilitate easy capture of musical notation by catalogers. Although now couched
        in normative language, the present specification does not deviate far from the earlier
        specifications&mdash;indeed, some changes that are introduced in this new version are drawn from
        the original papers by Brook and Gould. While some notable changes have been introduced to try and address
        common errors or ambiguities, Version 2 is largely an attempt to
        <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pave_the_cowpath">"pave the cowpaths"</a>; that is, to normalize and
        standardize existing practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        Catalogers who are familiar with Version 1 of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code may wish to consult
        the <a href="/v2/changes.html">Change Log</a> to see what has changed in Version 2.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Plaine &amp; Easie Code is maintained by the Digial and Editorial Centers of the
        Répertoire International des Sources Musicales (RISM), and by the International Association of Music
        Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres (IAML) for use as an exchange format in the library environment.
    </p>

            The archaic spelling of "Plaine and Easie" is a reference to <em>A Plaine and Easie Introduction to
            Practicall Musicke</em>, the 1597 music theory treatise by Thomas Morley.

    <h2>Staff Definitions</h2>
    <p>
        The clef, key signature, and time signature of an incipit is defined separately from the
        <a href="#musical-notation">Musical Notation</a> of the incipit. These properties affect the whole staff.
    </p>

        <h3>Clef</h3>
        <p>
            Every encoding MUST include a clef.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clef code MUST be three characters long. The first character specifies the clef shape and MUST
            be one of the values <code>G</code>, <code>g</code> (octave G), <code>C</code>, or <code>F</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second character MUST be one of the characters <code>-</code> to indicate modern notation,
            <code>*</code> to indicate mensural notation, or <code>:</code> to indicate neume notation. Each
            of these notations impose different interpretations on the music notation in the incipit.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third character MUST be a numeric value in the range 1-5, and indicates the reference staff line
            for the clef starting from the bottom.
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
            <p>
                A value for the clef field is required to ensure the visual rendering of the notation can accurately
                place the pitch values on the correct line or space within a staff.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            The clef indications imply the octave in which each note on the staff will sound and
            its visual placement on the staff. The following table gives the indicative octave and note
            for the bottom and top lines of each staff.

            An encoding MAY include a key signature.
        </p>
        <p>
            The character <code>x</code> indicates sharp keys and <code>b</code> flat keys. These characters MUST be
            followed by a list of <a href="#note-names">Note Names</a> to be altered accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The list of note names in a key signature SHOULD follow the <a>circle of fifths</a> ordering. Missing
            accidentals in this list SHOULD be supplied by the <a>transcriber</a>. Note names MUST NOT be repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
            All notes given in the key signature MUST be interpreted as having their sounding pitch altered
            accordingly. In cases where a note in a key signature is further altered by use of an
            <a href="#accidentals">accidental</a>, directly before the note, the <a>written pitch</a> and
            <a>sounding pitch</a> indicated by the accidental will take precedence.
        </p>
        <p>
            A key signature MAY contain note names within square brackets <code>[]</code> to indicate that the
            note names are not in the original source and have been supplied by the <a>transcriber</a>. Consecutively
            supplied note names MUST be within a single set of brackets. A key signature MAY contain more than one
            set of non-consecutive bracket groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            A key signature containing a single <code>n</code> character MAY be supplied to indicate a natural key
            signature, e.g., C Major or A minor. This character MUST NOT be followed by any note names.
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
            <p>
                While the key signature is an optional field, the absence of a key signature in the
                encoding can be ambiguous, since it may be interpreted either as a natural key signature (e.g.,
                C major) or it may indicate that a key signature was missing entirely from the original source.
                The <code>n</code> character can be used to explicitly mark a key signature with no
                sharps or flats.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            For neume notation, only the value of <code>bB</code> is permitted in the key signature. Any further
            alterations to individual pitches MUST be encoded as accidentals.

        <h3>Time Signature</h3>
        <p>
            An encoding MAY include a time signature.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two main categories of time signature forms, <a>Common Western Music Notation</a>
            (<abbr title="Common Western Music Notation">CWMN</abbr>) and Mensural.
        </p>
        <p>
            For neume notation, the time signature MUST remain unspecified.
        </p>
        <p>
            <abbr title="Common Western Music Notation">CWMN</abbr> and Mensural time signatures MUST NOT
            be mixed on the same staff.
        </p>
        <p>
            <abbr title="Common Western Music Notation">CWMN</abbr> time signatures are expressed as one number
            above another. These numbers MUST be separated by a <code>/</code> character. Any positive digit MAY
            be used, but <a>encoders</a> SHOULD use commonly accepted values where possible. The <code>c</code>
            ("common", or <code>4/4</code>) and <code>c/</code> ("alla breve", or <code>2/2</code>) characters
            MAY be used.
        </p>
        <p>
            <abbr title="Common Western Music Notation">CWMN</abbr> time signatures that indicate alternating
            measures MAY be indicated by transcribing both. These MUST be separated by a vertical bar
            <code>|</code> character.
        </p>
        <p>
            For mensuration signs, the <code>c</code> and <code>o</code> characters indicate imperfect and perfect
            tempus, respectively. The <code>.</code> character indicates "major" prolation; omitting <code>.</code>
            indicates "minor" prolation. A <code>/</code> character may follow the <em>tempus</em> character to
            indicate diminution.
        </p>
        <p>
            A mensuration sign MAY include a numerical component as a proportion or augmentation,
            indicating <em>modus cum tempore</em>. These numerals MUST be either a <code>3</code> or <code>2</code>.
            These numbers MAY be combined and separated by a <code>/</code>.

        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p>
            The Musical Notation section of an encoding is given as a single line of characters representing
            a <a>staff</a> of musical notation. <a>Notes and rests</a> are the most basic <a>logical units</a>
            of notation representation, composed of one or more characters that specify different attributes
            of a note or rest. Complex notational figures, such as chords, beams, or tuplets, serve
            to <a>group</a> notes and rests. <a>Expression Marks</a> alter the performance of a note, a rest, or
            groups thereof. Other <a>staff and measure symbols</a> can control the definition of the staff
            itself: bar lines, cross-measure rests, or a change of clef, key signature, or time signature.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many characters representing a musical note are optional&mdash;the only required character is the
            note name. Where one or more characters for a note occurs, they MUST occur in the following order:

        </table>
        <p>
            Logical units MAY be nested to represent complex notational features; for example, a beam will
            contain two or more notes, or a tuplet may be composed of two or more chords. All logical units
            of the same kind MUST be closed before a new one is started (i.e., no nested groups of the same kind).
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
            <p>
                There is one exception to this nested groups requirement: A group of notes marked as
                an <a>appoggiatura group</a> can occur within an outer group. This is explained further in
                the <a>appoggiatura group</a> section.
            </p>
        </aside>
        <p>
            Many logical units use the same characters to represent the same musical concept. Both notes and rests,
            for example, make use of the same duration characters.
        </p>
        <p>
            There MUST be no spaces within the Musical Notation section, except for the required space separating a
            change of <a>Clef, Key Signature, and Time Signature</a>.

                The sounding pitch of a note MAY be altered by both a key signature and an accidental. In the case of
                a note being altered by both, the alteration of the accidental MUST be interpreted as an alteration
                of the pitch defined by the key signature.
            </p>
            <p>
                A note SHOULD NOT be altered by the same accidental more than once within the same bar. The
                alteration to the sounding pitch of the note is continued on subsequent notes with the same <a>Note
                Name</a> until the next <a href="#bar-lines">Bar Line</a>. If the same accidental is given to several
                notes with the same <a>Note Name</a> within the bar, it will have no further effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accidentals MUST be interpreted by their written value, and MUST NOT be interpreted by their values

                    Accidentals are interpreted according to their written value. They do not have a cumulative effect

                Tied notes are indicated with an underscore character <code>_</code>. Tied notes consist of

                An underscore MAY be preceded by a <a href="#durations">duration</a> value, which serves to indicate

            <h4>Ligatures</h4>
            <p>
                Two notes joined in a ligature can be indicated with the lower-case character
                <code>u</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several consecutive notes MAY be joined in a single ligature by
                adding the <code>u</code> between each note.
            </p>
            <p>
                A ligature MUST NOT occur between a note and a rest, and MUST NOT occur between a note and a group
                of notes. (i.e., a beam, tuplet, or chord.) Ligatures also MUST NOT occur within a beam, tuplet,
                or chord.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a ligature character is used, it MUST be the final modifier, occuring after the pitch name and
                any other modifiers.

            <aside class="note">
                <p>
                    While some notation renderers may attempt to reproduce the shape of the ligature in its original
                    form, it is also common practice to indicate that two notes were in a ligature by including them
                    within a horizontal bracket. Both forms are valid visualizations of ligatures,
                    and the Plaine &amp; Easie Code does not dictate the use of one method or the other.

            <h4>Tuplets</h4>
            <p>
                A tuplet group MUST begin with a duration value to indicate the duration
                of the tuplet group.
            </p>
            <p>
                All musical symbols MAY occur within a tuplet group. The members of the tuplet
                group MUST be enclosed within parentheses <code>()</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The duration value MUST be provided for the first note or rest after the
                opening parenthesis <code>(</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A semicolon <code>;</code> and a positive integer MAY immediately precede
                the closing parenthesis of a tuplet group. This number indicates the number of
                beat divisions in the group; that is, the number of beats that occur within
                the tuplet in the space of the given duration value. If a number is not
                given, a value of <code>3</code> is the default.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the default number of beats in the tuplet is <code>3</code>, these two
                encodings of a triplet are considered to be equivalent:

            <p>
                For a single appoggiatura note, the lower-case character <code>q</code>
                MUST be used. This character MUST precede the note name, and MUST
                also precede all other optional attributes of the note.

                    For multiple consecutive appoggiatura notes, the appoggiatura group SHOULD
                    be used. The lower-case characters <code>y</code> MUST be given as the first
                    characters before the first note of the group, and the lower-case character
                    <code>r</code> MUST be the last character of the group. There MUST be more than
                    one note in an appoggiatura group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <code>r</code> character MUST follow the closing beam character
                    that is part of the appoggiatura group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An appoggiatura group with beams MAY occur within a non-appoggiatura
                    beam.

    <h2>Representation Formats</h2>
    <p>
        The original expression of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code was intended for physical
        media such as an index card, or a printed book. In the intervening years, usage of the
        Plaine &amp; Easie Code has shifted to use within a digital context, such as online
        library catalogs and on the World Wide Web.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section provides the specification of the acceptable representations of the Plaine &amp;
        Easie Code. It is expected that these representations—with the possible exception of
        "single-line text"—are constructed and used by automated tools and not written "by hand."
    </p>
    <section id="character-encodings">
        <h3>Character Encodings</h3>
        <p>
            All characters used in the Plaine &amp; Easie Code MUST be within the [[ASCII]]
            code range. Plaine &amp; Easie MAY be transmitted as part of another encoding standard,
            such as UTF-8, as long as the characters used within the encoding itself do not
            fall outside of the ASCII range.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on the application, some ASCII characters MAY be encoded in another
            way; for example, Plaine &amp; Easie Code could be embedded in HTML where some
            characters are replaced by <a data-cite="html#named-character-references">Named
            character references</a>.
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
            <p>
                Although alternate character encodings for ASCII are permitted, care should
                be taken that these encodings are "unescaped" correctly before the incipit
                is processed.
            </p>

        <h3>MARC21 and UNIMARC</h3>
        <p>
            The Plaine &amp; Easie code is accepted as a format within a MARC (MAchine Readable Catalogue)
            or UNIMARC (UNIversal MARC) record. The specifics of each system are given in the [[MARC21]]
            documentation or in the [[UNIMARC]] documentation. The <code>031</code> MARC21 field is used
            to record incipits, while UNIMARC uses the <code>036</code> field. The subfields used by these
            formats for Plaine &amp; Easie Code is given in [[[#marc21-unimarc-subfields]]].
        </p>
        <p>
            In both systems, the <code>$2</code> subfield indicates the coding system used for the
            incipit. This code MUST be <code>pe2</code> for Version 2 of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code.
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
            <p>
                The acceptance of the code <code>pe2</code> for MARC21 and UNIMARC subfield <code>$2</code>
                is dependent on the ratification of this code by the respective committees. Until this value
                has been ratified, it is recommended that Version 2 of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code is not
                represented in MARC21 or UNIMARC.
            </p>
            <p>
                This note will be removed when this code has been formally accepted by these standards.

        <h3>Multi-Line Text with Field Delimiters</h3>
        <p>
            The Plaine &amp; Easie Code MAY be represented in a multi-line text format.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each field MUST be separated by a newline character <code>\n</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each field MUST begin with a field identifier. This identifier consists of an at sign
            character <code>@</code>, followed by a field name. The field identifier MUST end with
            a colon character <code>:</code>.
        <p>
        <p>
            The field name MUST be one of the following: <code>clef</code>, <code>keysig</code>, <code>timesig</code>,
            <code>key</code>, <code>data</code>, or <code>version</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The field value MUST immediately follow the colon in the field identifier. The field value MUST NOT
            contain any characters that are not part of the value itself; for example, the value must not be
            enclosed in quotation marks.
        </p>
        <p>
            There MUST be at least two fields in the encoding: <code>clef</code> and <code>data</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>version</code> field MAY be included. The value of the <code>version</code> field
            MUST be <code>pe2</code> for incipits that conform to Version 2 of the specification. If a
            <code>version</code> field is not specified, the incipit SHOULD be interpreted as conforming
            to Version 1 of the specification.

        <h3>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</h3>
        <p>
            Plaine &amp; Easie Code MAY be represented as JavaScript Object Notation
            ([[JSON]]). All JSON encodings of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code MUST be valid
            JSON.
        </p>
        <p>
            The keys in the JSON MUST be one of the following: <code>clef</code>,
            <code>keysig</code>, <code>timesig</code>, <code>key</code>,
            <code>data</code>, or <code>version</code>. Unlike the multi-line text
            representation, they MUST NOT begin with an at sign character <code>@</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There MUST be at least two keys in the encoding: <code>clef</code> and <code>data</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <code>version</code> key MAY be included. The value of the <code>version</code> key
            MUST be <code>pe2</code> for incipits that conform to Version 2 of the specification. If a
            <code>version</code> key is not specified, the incipit SHOULD be interpreted as conforming
            to Version 1 of the specification.

        <h3>Single-Line Text</h3>
        <p>
            Plaine & Easie code MAY be represented in a single, continuous line of text.
        </p>
        <p>
            This line MUST start with the string <code>;pe2</code> for incipits that
            conform to Version 2 of the specification.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the version declaration, the line MUST continue with a declaration of the clef.
            The format of the clef declaration follows the same format for an inline change of clef;
            that is, the clef declaration MUST start with the percent character <code>%</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The line of text SHOULD specify a key signature and a time signature. This also
            follows the same format for an inline change of key and time signatures.
        <p>
            The clef, key signature, and time signature declarations MUST NOT themselves be
            separated by a space character.
        </p>
        <p>
            The clef, key signature and time signature MUST be separated from the rest of the music
            notation by a single space character.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of the line of text follows the format for the music notation section of the code.
            Further changes to the clef, key signature, and time signature are permitted as normal.
        </p>
        <aside class="note">
            <p>
                The single-line text representation does not permit the use of a version identifier.
                Extra care should be taken when trying to parse these representations that the version
                of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code represented is known.
