                This document is a companion to the Plaine &amp; Easie Version 2
                specifications. It describes the major differences between
                Version 1 and Version 2, including those that introduce
                compatibility issues between the two versions.

            <h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Clef is a required field</h3>
                <p>
                    It is now an error to have a Plaine &amp; Easie Code
                    document without also specifying a clef. This change was
                    introduced because the clef specifies the line on the staff
                    on which the note should be drawn, and without a clef this
                    is ambiguous.
                </p>

                <h3>Encoding of fermatas</h3>
                <p>
                    The lower-case character <code>p</code> was introduced to
                    indicate fermatas, replacing the previous practice of
                    enclosing the note in parentheses, <code>()</code>. This
                    change was introduced because the parentheses were already
                    in use as the enclosing characters for a rhythmic group
                    (i.e., tuplets), and there was no need to indicate more than
                    one note for a fermata.
                </p>

                <h3>Order of elements within a note</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Neume Notation</h3>
                <p>
                    Previously, neume notation was indicated with the special
                    duration of <code>7.</code>. This introduced an arbitrary
                    restriction on coding dotted 128th notes, while also making
                    it unclear whether neume notation could be mixed with other
                    types of notation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Version 2 introduces the <code>:</code> character in the
                    clef to indicated that it is neume notation, following the
                    same pattern established by Mensural notation.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Changed tie to underscore</h3>
                <p>
                    Previously, the plus character <code>+</code> was used to
                    indicate that two notes were tied. This created some
                    problems when using the Plaine &amp; Easie Code in a web
                    environment, where the <code>+</code>
                    symbol caused problems when it was instead interpreted as a
                    space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, the first version of the Plaine &amp; Easie
                    Code also used the underscore for tied notes.
