                This document is a companion to the Plaine &amp; Easie Version 2
                specifications. It describes the major differences between
                Version 1 and Version 2, including those that introduce
                compatibility issues between the two versions.

            <h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Clef is a required field</h3>
                <p>
                    It is now an error to have a Plaine &amp; Easie Code
                    document without also specifying a clef. This change was
                    introduced because the clef specifies the line on the staff
                    on which the note should be drawn, and without a clef this
                    is ambiguous.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Encoding of fermatas</h3>
                <p>
                    The lower-case character <code>p</code> was introduced to
                    indicate fermatas, replacing the previous practice of
                    enclosing the note in parentheses, <code>()</code>. This
                    change was introduced because the parentheses were already
                    in use as the enclosing characters for a rhythmic group
                    (i.e., tuplets), and there was no need to indicate more than
                    one note for a fermata.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Order of elements within a note</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Neume Notation</h3>
                <p>
                    Previously, neume notation was indicated with the special
                    duration of <code>7.</code>. This introduced an arbitrary
                    restriction on coding dotted 128th notes, while also making
                    it unclear whether neume notation could be mixed with other
                    types of notation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Version 2 introduces the <code>:</code> character in the
                    clef to indicated that it is neume notation, following the
                    same pattern established by Mensural notation.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Changed tie to underscore</h3>
                <p>
                    Previously, the plus character <code>+</code> was used to
                    indicate that two notes were tied. This created some
                    problems when using the Plaine &amp; Easie Code in a web
                    environment, where the <code>+</code>
                    symbol caused problems when it was instead interpreted as a
                    space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notably, the first version of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code
                    also used the underscore for tied notes. This was changed in
                    subsequent revisions, but is now reverted to its original
                    character.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>Removal of Coded Validity Note</h3>
                <p>
                    The previous version of the Plaine &amp; Easie Code had a
                    provision for a "coded validity note" that indicated whether
                    corrections had or had not been applied, or that the incipit
                    was transcribed into modern notation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Version 2 this has been removed. It was not deemed
                    expressive enough to be useful (it did not specify which
                    corrections had, or had not, been introduced). An evaluation
                    of the usage of this field showed no consistent application
                    of this field, so it was removed in favor of putting any
                    explanatory notes in a notes field.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Alternating Time Signatures</h3>
                <p>
                    Previously, alternating time signatures were separated by a
                    space character. This caused some ambiguities since the
                    space character was used as a separator for clef, key, and
                    time changes inline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Version 2 this has been changed to a vertical bar,
                    <code>|</code>.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Mensural Notation</h3>
                <p>
                    Previously, the <code>+</code> character was used in clefs
                    to indicate the staff should be rendered in mensural notation.
                    Due to the same problems in encoding that had us remove it for ties,
                    the <code>+</code> character was replaced with a <code>*</code>
                    character in the clef for indicating mensural notation.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Appogiatura Group Opening Character</h3>
                <p>
                    Previously the characters <code>qq</code> were used to start
                    an appogiatura (a.k.a grace note) group. However, this was
                    the only instance in the Plaine &amp; Easie Code where two
                    characters were used to start a group. It also meant that
                    parsing the code was a bit more difficult, since it created
                    ambiguities between a single `q`, or a single appogiatura
                    notes, or a group of notes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Version 2 the start of an appogiatura group is now
                    signalled by the lower-case letter <code>y</code>. It is
                    still ended by the lower-case letter <code>r</code>.

            <h2>New Features</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Introduction of JSON as a representation format</h3>
                <p>
                    JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is now an accepted
                    representation format for the Plaine &amp; Easie Code.
                </p>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Clarifications</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Order of elements within a note</h3>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Key and Mode</h3>
                <p>
                    The ability to explicitly state key and / or mode in Plaine &amp; Easie was not included
                    in Version 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The status of this ability was unclear. MARC21 (<code>$r</code>) and UNIMARC permit the encoding
                    of key and mode, and indeed the MARC21 documentation states that the format of this field comes
                    from the Plaine &amp; Easie Code. However, the latest updates to Version 1 of the Code did not
                    actually specify this format.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ability to encode the key or mode of a piece was available in the initial versions of the
                    Plaine &amp; Easie Code, but the format of this field was not strictly defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was decided to not formalize this field in Version 2 of the Code. The judgement of a major
                    or a minor key is not strictly necessary for capturing the notation of an incipit, and instead is
                    something that should be captured in an explanatory note or a dedicated cataloguing field. The
                    application of this field, particularly in the capture of non-CWMN music, would also require
                    expanding the format and validation of the values beyond a simple rubric.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The effect of this change may be that the subfield remains available in MARC21 and UNIMARC, but the
                    format is no longer defined in reference to the Plaine &amp; Easie Code.
