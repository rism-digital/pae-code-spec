            <p>
                These cataloging guidelines are written as an accompaniment to
                the Plaine &amp; Easie Code (PAEC) specification. In previous
                editions of the specifications, the formal description of the
                code, and the guidelines for its interpretation, were given as a
                single document. Although convenient as a reference, it also
                posed significant challenges for the interpretation of what was
                actually <em>required</em>, and what was <em>recommended</em>.
                In the new edition of the PAEC, the specification document
                provides a formal description of a valid PAEC encoding, while
                this document will provide recommendations on the application of
                the code to incipit capture.

            <h2>Considerations for Incipit Capture</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    The thematic index derives its superiority over non-thematic
                    lists be cause it can not only arrange a body of music in a
                    systematic order, but it provides, at the same time,
                    positive identification in a minimum of space and symbols.
                    It does so by the use of the "incipit," or musical citation
                    of the opening notes. For most music, an incipit of no more
                    than a dozen pitches is required. When rhythmic values
                    accompany the pitches, the incipit's "uniqueness quotient"
                    is astonishingly high.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A musical work, printed or manuscript, may be identified by
                    composer, title, opus number, key, instrumentation, movement
                    headings, first line of text, date, publisher, dedicatee,
                    plate number, etc. No one of these, indeed no combination of
                    these, can provide as certain an identification as an
                    incipit. For example, an anonymous 15th-century Latin motet
                    may also appear as a French chanson entitled "L'amant
                    douloureux." A composer may write a dozen trio sonatas in D
                    major, three of them with the same tempo sequence. A concert
                    aria found in a library in Vienna, in the key of F, may turn
                    up in Prague in the key of G, and with added horn parts. Two
                    printings of a set of quartets may be given different plate
                    numbers by the same publisher. Two publications of the same
                    opera, in different cities, may bear different titles, and
                    dedications to different patrons. Finally, a set of six
                    symphonies may be published in Amsterdam with one opus
                    number, in Offenbach with another, and in London within a
                    series of Periodical Overtures without any at all, and under
                    another composer's name.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By contrast, the presence of the incipit avoids confusion.
                    Identification is certain. Even transposed works can be
                    readily identified in properly organized incipit files. In
                    dealing with anonymi and with works of disputed authorship,
                    the incipit becomes indispensable-as a catalog without them
                    will readily demonstrate. In short, the collection,
                    classification, transposition, and lexicographical ordering
                    of the incipits into thematic catalogs have enabled scholars
                    to solve a myriad of otherwise insoluble problems, and have
                    provided musicians, librarians, students, biographers, and
                    program annotators with an invaluable reference tool.

            <p>
                The cataloging of musical incipits in RISM is primarily intended
                for the purposes of identification and disambiguation, where all
                other bibliographic means of doing so are not sufficient to
                uniquely identify a musical piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most important component of incipit cataloging is the
                capture of identifiable musical material. This will, in most
                cases, be the opening measures of a piece. It may, occasionally,
                be the entrance of a melodic instrument when the opening of the
                piece starts with otherwise ambiguous accompaniment, such as a
                ground bass. In rare instances, it may be the entrance of a
                theme that is many measures in.
            </p>
            <p>
                In all cases, the encoder of the incipit must keep in mind the
                primary motivations of identification and disambiguation when
                choosing the musical content to capture as the incipit. It does
                not serve the users of the catalog to encode a unique part of a
                musical work when all other instances of the incipit in the
                catalog identify the opening measures. The uniqueness of the
                cataloging simply means that the incipit will not group with
                like, and it will thus be "lost" in the larger catalog.
            </p>
            <p>
                The capture of melodic and rhythmic qualities is of primary
                importance. Considerations of visual appearance, phrasing,
                polyphony, or other special indications are of secondary
                importance, or should be ignored altogether, when capturing
                incipits. While it may seem important to capture for any single
                given source, it can also pose significant challenges to
                positive identification or disambiguation when compared to all
                other sources. Other means of capture, such as analytical notes
                fields, may be a more suitable mechanism for accurately
                describing these features.

            <h2>The Plaine &amp; Easie Code</h2>
            <p>
                From the beginning, the PAEC was purpose-built for the capture
                of identifying incipits. It could be written by hand, or typed
                on a standard mechanical typewriter. Unlike other codes, the
                goal of the PAEC was to be simple. Indeed, the first version of
                the PAEC, issued in 1964, was subsequently simplified in 1965,
                to "make the code more usable on an international basis."
                (Brook, Fontes, 1965). The current PAEC specification is based
                primarily on this simplified version.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the intervening years since the introduction of the PAEC, a
                number of changes and additional features have been introduced.
                In some cases these additions have significantly improved the
                coding scheme; in other cases the additions have ultimately
                distracted from the central purpose of the PAEC when put into
                practice. The reasons for these changes are not always known.
                They may have been in response to a specific need, or they may
                have been added as a "nice-to-have" without an identified use
                case. Whatever the reason, they have been available and widely
                adopted and standardized, making it difficult to introduce
                retrospective changes to the coding system to address problems
                and clarify ambiguities. With no clear versioning scheme in
                place, the previous version is now no longer updated, and is now
                known as "Version 1".
            </p>
            <p>
                The new version, Version 2, contains several
                backwards-incompatible changes from Version 1. It is not the
                case that incipits in Version 1 need to be "upgraded," nor is it
                a problem to have software or other standards support PAEC
                Version 1. It is simply a way to differentiate the two versions.
                In most cases, unless the version of the incipit is plainly
                stated as being Version 2, it should be assumed that it is
                supposed to conform to Version 1 of the specification.
            </p>
            <section>
                <h3>Version 2</h3>
                <p>
                    The goals of the effort behind Version 2 were to clarify
                    ambiguities in the previous specification, and to make the
                    PAEC more suitable for machine processing of incipits. Since
                    the previous version was developed before the World Wide
                    Web, and even before there was software available to render
                    the code into a graphical representation, several parts of
                    the specification existed that made it difficult to
                    unambiguously and reliably process the data into the
                    notation it was intended to represent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Version 2 of the specification is written to make the
                    requirements of the encoding system clear, to help software
                    developers to build applications that can process the data
                    in a uniform way. The requirements are given using
                    [RFC2119], which provide keywords, such as "MUST" and "MAY",
                    to indicate required or optional features, respectively.
                    Most of the sections in the specification have also been
                    expanded to include an actual description of the code, as
                    well as illustrative examples.

            <h2>General Guidelines for Incipit Capture</h2>
            <p>
                Music incipits help identify works and facilitate the comparison
                of historical musical sources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Which music incipits to enter depends on the kind of music. Best
                practice for instrumental music is to enter incipits for the
                violin or the highest part. For vocal music, enter the highest
                voice plus the first violin or the highest instrumental part.
            </p>
            <p>
                The incipit should be neither too long nor too short, and make
                as much musical sense as possible. It should contain at least 3
                bars or 10 non-repeated notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the music is written for a transposing instrument, notate the
                incipit at sounding pitch.
