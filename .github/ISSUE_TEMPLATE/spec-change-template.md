**Summary**: Provide a summary of the change. See below for suggestions on how to write this.

**Background**: Provide a longer justification with more details on why the existing methods are not sufficient. You can also provide possible solutions.

---DELETE THE FOLLOWING CONTENT---

For the summary, it can be helpful to provide concrete, real-world examples gathered from people in specific roles to justify the change. You might use the following wording:

"As a _____ (insert your role) I would like to ____ (a brief description of what you would like to do) so that I can _____ (a brief description of the impact of your change)."

For example:

"As a software developer, I would like chords to be encoded using angle brackets (<>), so that I can more accurately parse encoded chords in PAE."

You can then go on to elaborate your change in the background section. It is usually helpful to provide some details on how the current specification does not meet your needs. This is to both illustrate that you have read and considered the current state of the specification, and to help the specification editors group changes in similar areas of the specification.
