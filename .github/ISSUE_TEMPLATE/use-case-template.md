In a Use Case, we are specifically interested in concrete, real-world examples gathered from people in specific roles. You might use the following wording:

"As a _____ (insert your role) I would like to ____ (a brief description of what you would like to do) so that I can _____ (a brief description of the impact of your change)."

For example:

"As a software developer, I would like chords to be encoded using angle brackets (<>), so that I can more accurately parse encoded chords in PAE."

You can then go on to elaborate your change. It is usually helpful to provide some details on how the current specification does not meet your needs. This is to both illustrate that you have read and considered the current state of the specification, and to help the specification editors group changes in similar areas of the specification.
